I do not know precisely how long this homework took because I did it between
other deadlines.


Task 1

 - For this task I researched online Dijkstra's algorithm and adapted it 
as I saw fit.
 - In its implementation, I also used an array which was keeping the nodes
that were included in the shortest path to the warehouse and back to the store.
 - In the last phase, I calculated the total cost and printed what was needed.


Task 2

 - For this task I also researched online an algorithm,Tarjan's algorithm, 
and adapted it as I saw fit.
 - This algorithm determines the strong connected components in a graph
 - After I descovered them, I placed them in a matrix, which I sorted it
 - At last, I printed the matrix


Task 3

 - This task was terrible
 - I used queues as explained in the homework
 - I created all the possible routes and I avoided infinit cicles comparing 
every route with the previous one
 - In the last phase I chose the minimum cost and printed it
